This creates a single node cluster with 6GB memory for your account.\n\nStep IV: Go back to homepage, and choose \"Import Notebook.\" Upload the IPython assignment notebook by following the prompts and open the notebook. Rename the notebook from \"hw3_ctr_student.ipynb\" to \"andrewid_hw3_ctr_student.ipynb\" where \"andrewid\" is your actual Andrew ID.\n\nStep V: By default, the notebook is not attached to a Spark cluster and will show \"Detached\" as its status at the top of the notebook in the browser. Click on the \"Detached\" status and attach it to your cluster. It should now show the message as \"Attached (cluster name)\"\n\nStep VI: You can now import pyspark into the notebook. Also, attaching to the DataBricks Community Edition cluster automatically provides the SparkContext variable \"sc\" to the Python code in your notebook.
